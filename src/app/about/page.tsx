      <h1>Meet the Developer</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Keanu Rea√±o, a software engineer based in the Philippines. I chose
        software engineering because it combines two of my greatest passions:
        building and automating. Building allows me to have a hands on
        experience and see the results of my work. Automating frees me from
        repetitive tasks, giving me more time to focus on creative and strategic
        thinking.

      <h1>About this Website</h1>
      <p>
        This page was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I chose Next.js for
        its versatile page routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
        Additionally, I integrated a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which
        automatically builds and deploys the website every time I push to the
        main branch.
