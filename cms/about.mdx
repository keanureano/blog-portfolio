## _About Me_

Hi there!👋

I started as a freelance video editor while studying computer science.
To keep up with deadlines, I built automations to lighten my workload.
These were small tools that saved me time and let me focus on the actual creative work.

After graduating, I got into web development.
I built everything from simple landing pages to full-stack web apps.
It was fun for a while, but it didn't feel right.
I didn't just want to build websites, I wanted to build systems that helped people work better.
Kind of like how my own tools made editing easier for me.

Eventually, I found a niche in automation development.
I focused on low-code platforms like Airtable, Make, and n8n, and started working with small to mid-sized companies.
I built systems that connected tools, cleaned up workflows, and removed a lot of the boring, manual stuff people didn't want to do.

A lot of the things I've built have had a real impact.
It helped teams save hours, avoid errors, and just have an easier time doing their work.
That's the kind of job I want to keep doing.

I'm still figuring things out as I go, but I try to aim high with every project I take on, even if the outcome isn't always perfect.
