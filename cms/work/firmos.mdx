# How I Designed a scalable CRM & ATS with LLM-Powered Automation

## _Intro_

**FirmOS** helps accounting firms grow by connecting them with qualified leads and top talent.
But as their own client base scaled rapidly, their internal systems began to strain under the pressure.

They were managing everything in **Airtable** - from sales pipelines to applicant tracking, but the setup wasn't designed for **scale**.
Data was fragmented, workflows were manual, and decision-making was slowing down.

I stepped in to re-architect the system so that instead of duplicating bases and automations for every new client, we could **sync filtered views** from a central database.

This allowed us to maintain a single **source of truth** while giving each client a **customized view** of their data.
