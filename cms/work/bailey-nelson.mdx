# _How I Built a Lightweight ERP for Bailey Nelson Using Airtable and Make.com_

## _Intro_

**Bailey Nelson**, an eyewear retailer operating across multiple countries, came to me with a problem: their systems weren't talking to each other.

They were scaling quickly, with **NetSuite** handling finance, **POS systems** in stores, and a patchwork of **spreadsheets** and **emails** filling the gaps.
Off-the-shelf ERP solutions were too rigid, too slow to implement, or simply overkill for their needs.

So I built a custom, lightweight ERP - using **Airtable** as the central hub and **Make.com** to handle the integrations.
It was fast to deploy, easy for teams to use, and flexible enough to grow with the business.
